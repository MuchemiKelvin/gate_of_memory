Kardiverse Mobile — Implementation Summary

Implemented in this session:
- Database media schema alignment: added migration v3 to match `Media`/`MemorialService` fields (`local_path`, `remote_url`, `file_size`, `file_type`, `mime_type`) with safe data copy and table swap.
- Camera → AR QR pipeline: `RealCameraService` now forwards throttled frames into `RealQRDetectionService.processFrame`, enabling in-session QR detection.
- Hologram MVP: AR overlay now supports video-based hologram preview using `video_player`, and `RealARSessionManager` passes `hologramPath` from content loading to the overlay.
- Geo-blocker fixes: corrected string interpolations for coordinates and messaging.
- Category seeding: seeds predefined categories on empty DB during init.
- Cleanup: removed unused `http` dependency from `pubspec.yaml`.

What remains (optional/next):
- Fully-fledged 3D/AR hologram rendering (beyond video-based MVP).
- Add memorial create/edit screens (dashboard FAB TODO).
- Tests for DB, geo-blocking, and QR validation flows.
- Release checks on target devices and platform-specific gating.

Status: App builds after dependency fetch; lints clean for changed files. AR scanning path is connected; media schema is consistent with code; overlay shows video holograms.
